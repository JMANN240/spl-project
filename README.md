# Structure of Programming Languages Project
## Spring 2021

This is a project for SPL comparing two programming languages by writing the same program in two different languages and paradigms. In this project, Rust and Python will be compared using a program to find the n-th Fibonacci number. The Rust implementation is written using a procedural approach, while the Python implementation is written using an object-oriented approach. The individual implementations can be found in the corresponding subdirectories.
